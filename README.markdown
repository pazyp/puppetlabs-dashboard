# Puppet Dashboard Module

Andrew Pazikas <andrewpazikas@gmail.com>

This module manages and installs the Puppet Dashboard.  It also includes a Puppet Face to manage the Dashboard/Console programmatically or from the CLI

# Quick Start

To install the Puppet Dashboard and configure it with sane defaults, include the following in your site.pp file:

    node default {
			   class {'dashboard':
			     dashboard_ensure          => 'present',
			     dashboard_user            => 'puppet-dbuser',
			     dashboard_group           => 'puppet-dbgroup',
			     dashboard_password        => 'changeme',
			     dashboard_db              => 'dashboard_prod',
			     dashboard_charset         => 'utf8',
			     dashboard_site            => $fqdn,
			     dashboard_port            => '8080',
			     mysql_root_pw             => 'changemetoo',
			     passenger                 => true,
			   }
		}

None of these parameters are required - if you neglect any of them their values will default back to those set in the dashboard::params subclass.

# Don't install passenger

You may want that puppet dashboard uses passenger, but install it by some other mean that using this module.
In that case, simply add passenger_install => false to the class parameters.

In that case, you will need to:

* Install passenger module yourself
* Setup apache modules yourself, especially, you need to be sure that passenger.load and passenger.conf exist in puppet.

# Puppet Dashboard Face

The Puppet Dashboard Face requires that the cloud provisioner version 1.0.0 is installed
and in Ruby's loadpath (which can be set with the RUBYLIB environment variable)

To use the Puppet Dashboard Face:


* Ensure that you have Puppet 2.7.6 or greater installed.  This face MAY work on version 2.7.2 or later, but it's not been tested.
* Download or clone puppetlabs-dashboard to your Puppet modulepath (i.e. ~/.puppet/modules or /etc/puppet/modules)
        export RUBYLIB=/etc/puppet/modules/dashboard/lib:$RUBYLIB

* Test the face and learn more about its usage

        puppet help dashboard

# Feature Requests

* Sqlite support.
* Integration with Puppet module to set puppet.conf settings.
* Remove the need to set the MySQL root password (needs fixed in the mysql module)
